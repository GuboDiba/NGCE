        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>Nomad Girl Child Empowerment (NGCE) is a community-based organization formed in 2021 with the aim of eradicating child marriages, teenage pregnancies, and female genital mutilation (FGM) to restore the dignity of young girls in society. The organization is based in Marsabit County in Northern Kenya and is a non-membership organization. The nomads’ communities have limited awareness and respect of rights related to women’s empowerment. Through NGCE, women are empowered with new life skills to express themselves and set and pursue their goals without being held back by cultural and stereotyped limitations. To that effect, NGCE seeks to address these traditional ideas of what women’s or girls’ roles should be in nomadic communities that hold back girls and women from contributing to important development goals through educational empowerment beyond the secondary level, rather than getting married before they achieve their fruitful dreams.</p>
